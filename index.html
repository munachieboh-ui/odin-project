              About the strawberry buttermilk pancakes, which is the same base
              as today's, one reader, Julie, commented: “These are INCREDIBLE! I
              love how fluffy and tender they are—and I love that I don't have
              to beat the egg whites separately. SO SO SO good. I hope you enjoy
              making these pancakes as much as i do. Happy cooking!
